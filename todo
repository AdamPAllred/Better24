IDEA: have a game.js with our current stuff,
and then a intro-screen.js which lets them choose a number and
all that good stuff?

intro-screen.js could just update the innerHTML value for
the goal-num div, and then game.js could read it right
off of there so we wouldn't have to import/export
any vars between files

Link up keyboard controls? (r = redo, enter = next, 1 = first num...)

Finished:

- Redo button

suggestion from my dad (Jon): add a crumb trail to show
what's been happening (e.g. 27 - 4 = 23 * 6 = 1231231231...)

- disable the hover effect and grey the border when btn inactive

- check if the num = the goal num at the end
  - and if not, say "you lost" and reset the numbers to enables so you can try again at the same puzzle
